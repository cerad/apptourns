Manage Multiple Tournaments
===========================

28 March 2015

Doing some cleanup for the Classic2015 tournament.

The TournsBundle is not being used at all.
The ArbiterBundles is being used for commands.

Dependent on Core/Game/User/Person/Project zayso2016 bundles

Using routes from UserBundle and GameBundle

Had some code for an api.  Commented it out.
